## emptyarray

productivity without tedious templates â€” a notion alternative that loads fast and purpose built for getting things done;

in emptyarray everything is treated as objects with dynamic types (meetings, linear issues, notes are all objects with specific types e.g., type:meeting, type:todo, type:note).
and blocks ( list, calendar, board, note, journal) are like Lego but customisable by rules, filter, sort, view, size.
an array is a blank canvas where you can add one or as many blocks you want.

some examples of array:
