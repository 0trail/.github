## March

second brain for people living on mars;

an email like interface with splits â€” connected with your productivity stack (calendar, github, slack, linear) to help you get things done.  

in march everything is treated as objects with types (meetings, linear issues, notes, and more are all objects with specific types e.g., type:meeting, type:todo, type:note).  

## ðŸš€ features

- array (split view like superhuman): create an array to see specific set of action items, the default arrays are current date to show all the objects related to that date and inbox to hold all unorganised objects.  

- agentic via command k: can talk to all connected apps and perform actions, gather action items that matters or even suggest you to do things.  

- dynamic interface: you can customise a view (list, board, graph) of an object (note, todo, page) by its type.  

- rulesets: create intelligent rules like:  
  - hey march, keep suggesting me object, type: articles I saved and objects, type: tweets I bookmarked during the weekend.  
  - send me a weekly summary email about what I have done with a procrastination score.
